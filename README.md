# Elements Done Well

### `UI Design`

The Design of the page is just as per the specification.


### `Search`

# Further improvements I could've done

### `Dark Mode`

I could've added a toggle-able dark mode if I had more time.


### `Search Filters and Sorting`
I could've added various filters like genre, runtime, language etc.
